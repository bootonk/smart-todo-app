### User stories

1. As a non-logged in user: 
  - I want to be prompted to login because my lists will be saved to my account to keep track of

2. As a logged in user:
  - I want to only see one input field to add to but see the item added to the correct list because I don't want to organize the lists myself
  - I want to see my lists and no one elses because I'm just keeping track of my own items
  - I only want to see lists that have more than 0 items because I don't want to see empty lists I'm not using
  - I want to update the item's category and text because the suggested smart category may be wrong or I may have a typo
  - I want to share my list to my friends and family- or myself, because it saves time in sharing and keeps lists handy
  - I want to see a checkbox that I can check when I'm done because I want to follow the list to complete my work
  - I want to be able to delete an item from a list because I might have changed my mind

  logged-in user STRETCH stories
  - I want to be able to see a history of completed items that expand because I want to remember what's completed without it taking up space
  - I want to see the total count of list items that are not completed when I see all the category names because I want to know what is piling up
  - I want to see the date the todo was created so I can sort and keep track of items
  - I want to see an autocomplete option for my item because I hate typing
  - I want to drag and drop an item into a list if it didn't get categorized because I want everything organized even if the smart app didn't work
  - I want to see a search bar that lets me search anything because I may have common elements across my lists
